# CS2513
2nd Year Computer Science - Intermediate Programming (Python)

Repository storing code from assessments for CS2513 module.

Continuous Assessment 1 was a simple enough project aimed at having us utilise the various OOP concepts we had learned.
No GUI was required, the focus was on the object-oriented programming done in the project & quality of such work.
I chose to make the backbone character classes to an RPG that is based on Demon Slayer, an anime I am a fan of. User interaction is all based in the CLI.
I received a grade of 10/10 for this project submission.

Continuous Assessment 2 was focused on game development concepts, incorporating OOP aswell. We used the PyGame library to explore game dev in Python.
We all were given the same project in essence, which was to make classic space invaders style game.
I stuck to the book with this project and did not reinvent the wheel in any manner. I did however make the 8-bit music for the game :)... why not?
I received a grade of 10/10 for this project submission.

Overall grade for this module was 85/100 (1.1 Honours)
